Adminastrative and Game Management Uses:
admins should youse the /admin url to accesss the django administration page. From here they cand do a number of actions

quiz creation ~ to create a quiz minigame, first add a quiz. Once a quiz is added, questions must be added in the questions section and the quiz they are being added to must be selected in the drop down menu for each question. answers can be added from this menu or the answers menu and each question should have 1 correct answer. there is a results tabl that allows an adminto view the results of quizes in isolation from the main points system in order to gauge difficulty. The url /list is also a page accessible only to super users that allows any quiz to be accessed. this feature is primarily here so that the urls can be retrieved for the qr codes later.

qr code linking ~ admins can generate qr codes by enetering the website database section, to generate a qr code, click add then paste a url into the Name field and save. a file can be used to replace the generated qr code if needed.

Regular Users:
should access minigames via qr codes (can be found in our development documentation)
can navigate the rest of the website via the nav bar
